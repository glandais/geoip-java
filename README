To get started, run

cd source/com/maxmind/geoip/
javac *.java
cd -
CLASSPATH=".:source" javac *.java
CLASSPATH=".:source" java CountryLookupTest

By default, CountryLookupTest expects to find the
GeoIP Country database in /usr/local/share/GeoIP/GeoIP.dat

IMPORTANT API Change for 1.1.x users - as of GeoIP 1.1.0 the
lookupCountryXxxx methods return null if a country can not
be found (it used to return '--' or 'N/A'.  Be sure to check the
return value for null !

This is version 1.1.8 of the Java interface to GeoIP.  For more information
see http://www.maxmind.com/

As of version 1.1.4 this API is fully thread safe.

To get started for GeoIP Country, look at the code in CountryLookupTest.java.

CityLookupTest.java contains an example for the MaxMind GeoIP City database.
OrgLookupTest.java contains examples for the GeoIP Organization and ISP databases.
RegionLookupTest.java contains an example for the MaxMind GeoIP Region database.
NetspeedLookupTest.java contains an example for the MaxMind GeoIP Netspeed database.

Note that CountryLookupTest assumes that you have the GeoIP Country database
installed at /usr/local/share/GeoIP/GeoIP.dat

The GeoIP Free Country database is available from
