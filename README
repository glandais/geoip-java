IMPORTANT API Change for 1.1.x users - as of GeoIP 1.1.0 the
lookupCountryXxxx methods return null if a country can not
be found (it used to return '--' or 'N/A'.  Be sure to check the
return value for null !

This is version 1.1.0 of the Java interface to GeoIP.  For more information
see http://www.maxmind.com/

To get started, look at the code in CountryLookupTest.java.

Note that this example program assumes that you have the GeoIP database
installed at /usr/local/share/GeoIP/GeoIP.dat .

If you haven't installed the GeoIP C library, you'll need to download the
database from
