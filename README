IMPORTANT API Change for 1.1.x users - as of GeoIP 1.1.0 the
lookupCountryXxxx methods return null if a country can not
be found (it used to return '--' or 'N/A'.  Be sure to check the
return value for null !

This is version 1.1.3 of the Java interface to GeoIP.  For more information

To get started for GeoIP Country, look at the code in CountryLookupTest.java.

CityLookupTest.java contains an example for the GeoIP City database.
OrgLookupTest.java contains examples for the GeoIP Organization and ISP databases.

Note that this example program assumes that you have the GeoIP database
installed at /usr/local/share/GeoIP/GeoIP.dat .

If you haven't installed the GeoIP C library, you'll need to download the
GeoIP Standard Country database from
